# Little Lemon Booking App

This Booking App was created as the final capstone project of the **Meta Front-End Developer Certification**.

## **Preview**

Little Lemon is a family-owned Mediterranean restaurant that blends traditional recipes with a modern twist. Our goal is to provide our customers with a unique dining experience that will take them on a culinary journey through the Mediterranean.

**Live Site:** [Little Lemon Booking App](https://littlelemonbookingapp.netlify.app/)

## **Instructions Received**

The objective was to create a modern, responsive Front-end for the Little Lemon app with a **Bookings feature**, which the restaurant currently lacks.
